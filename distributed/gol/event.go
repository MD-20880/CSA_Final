// This might all seem like weird syntax to you...
// You have however seen something similar to it before in first year.

// In the Go code an Interface called Event is created, this provides a set of methods that
// need to be defined for something to have the type Event.

// This is a similar concept to typeclasses in Haskell. A typeclass called Event could be defined.
// It would require two methods to be implemented: string and getCompletedTurns. Note the
// similarities between the type signatures of the Go and Haskell functions.

/*
> class Event event where
>   string :: event -> String
>   getCompletedTurns :: event -> Int
*/

// A new data type called ImageOutputComplete can then be created, just like in Go.

/*
> data ImageOutputComplete = ImageOutputComplete Int String
*/

// Now in the Go code extension methods are created for the ImageOutputComplete so that it
// provides the methods required for the Event Inteface. Similarly in Haskell, an instance
// of the typeclass Event can be created.

/*
> instance Event ImageOutputComplete where
>   string (ImageOutputComplete t f) = concat ["Turn ", show t, " - File ", f, " output complete"]
>   getCompletedTurns (ImageOutputComplete t f) = t
